# dCommands
dCommands is just a console app that execute some commands.
I know it's better to use the default cmd but I thought it
should be fun to create my own. And I thought right.

# Features
The commands introduced can take up to two arguments.

Right know there are just a few commands available, there are:
* exit : It's obvious what this command does.
* file_create : This command creates a file, it takes 2 arguments, 
the name of the file and the content. Example: file new_file.txt 'This is written in the file.'
* file_open : This command shows the content of the text file that is 
introduced as it's only needed argument. Example: file_open new_file.txt

# Rules
Since I have only been making this for an afternoon a haven't been
able to make the program smart enough, so, there are some rules,
that way the app will behave as expected.
* There should be NO spaces at the beginning of a line.
* There should be only one space between de command an the arguments.

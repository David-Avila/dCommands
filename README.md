# dCommands
dCommands is just a console app that execute some commands.

# Features
The commands introduced can take up to two arguments. You can convert from
farenheit degrees to celcius , and vice versa. You can calculate the square root
Of a number. I will add more commands soon.

Right know there are just a few commands available. To see them just
write the command help and you'll get the list of commands along with 
the description.


# Rules
Since I have only been making this for an afternoon a haven't been
able to make the program smart enough, so, there are some rules,
that way the app will behave as expected.
* There should be NO spaces at the beginning of a line.
* There should be only one space between de command an the arguments.
* If the command expect a number don't write a letter.

# Thanks you!!
